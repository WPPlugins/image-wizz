Banner wizz gives you the possibility to add contextual banner ads at the end of every post of your blog , based on keywords occurrences. Because your blog will have a relevant banner ad on every post ,the plugin will help you maximize your conversions  with affiliate programs, products, services or sites you promote on your blog. 



== Description ==
Image resize wizz automatically resizes the images in posts to fit a maximum specified width. The pictures are not physically modified, the plugin only modifies the way the theme displays them in a post. 


How does it work?
After you set a maximum width  from the admin panel, all the pictures that have a larger width than the one you have specified will  be displayed in the post scaled down to the width you have set.    
The graphic file is not physically altered or modified, the plugin only resizes the output shown in the browser.
